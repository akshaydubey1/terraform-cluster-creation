# terraform-cluster-creation
By following these steps, you will create an EKS cluster with Terraform and deploy a Kubernetes Job that manages the lifecycle of pods using the provided Python script.


To create a Kubernetes cluster using Terraform and then apply the above project (Python script to manage pods), follow these steps:

Step 1: Install Terraform
First, make sure you have Terraform installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Terraform website.

Step 2: Set Up AWS CLI
Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the appropriate credentials.

a Terraform Script for EKS Cluster
Create a main.tf file with the following content to define the EKS cluster and its resources.

Step 4: Initialize and Apply Terraform Configuration
Run the following commands to initialize and apply the Terraform configuration:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
terraform apply
This will create an EKS cluster along with the necessary IAM roles, policies, VPC, and subnets.

Step 5: Configure kubectl
After the EKS cluster is created, configure kubectl to connect to the new cluster:

bash
Copy code
aws eks --region us-west-2 update-kubeconfig --name example-cluster
Step 6: Deploy the Python Script to Manage Pods
You can create a Kubernetes Job to run the Python script. First, create a Dockerfile for the Python script:



Apply the Job to your Kubernetes cluster:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f job.yaml
Summary
Terraform Script: Defines the infrastructure for an EKS cluster.
Dockerfile: Containerizes the Python script.
Kubernetes Job: Runs the Docker container in the EKS cluster.
